        <p> Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. This IDE is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <h2>Console screen</h2>
        <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.</p>
